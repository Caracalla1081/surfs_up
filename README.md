# Surfs Up: Surf and Shake Shop Investment Analysis of Weather Patterns

## Overview of Analysis
In an effort to open up a "Surf and Shake Shop" in Hawaii, it is imperative that I find outside investors to partner with me to get the shop off the ground and running. One particular investor, W. Avy, loves surfing, but is apprehensive about weather impacts on the success of the shop due to a prior investment in a surf shop that failed because of constant rain. 

In order to help boster my cause to gain his trust in investing in my shop, I must run analysis on a weather data set that W. Avy has provided me, for the very island I plan on building my shop on.

## Analysis Results of Weather comparison of June and December

### Precipitation:

- The max day of preceipitation was higher in December by 2in. than it was in June

### Temperatures:

- The average temperature in June is 3 degrees higher than in December
- At the same time even though the average temperature is only 3 degrees higher in June in comparison with December, the minimum temperature in June was 10 degrees higher than the minimum in December.
- - The gap does narrow as we move up each quarter percentile

## Summary of Analysis
After looking at the results of the temperature comparisons between December and June, as well as the additional queries that I performed to gather the descriptive statistics for precipitation during those months; it would be my position that the weather over the course of the year is such to sustain the "Surf and Shake Shop" year-round. 

I base this on the images related above that show very little overall variance in temperatures and precipitation when comparing the two weather points for December and June. Yes, the minimum temperature in December is almost ten full degreees lower than the minimum temperature in June, but as we look at the higher quarter percentile numbers we see that the gap does narrow to a negligable level overall. In regards to precipitation there is not a significant variance in any of the descriptive statistics between the two months to draw a conclusion that weather would impact one month more than the other.

If there was one caveat I would raise, and this could be solved by a few more queries, is that I would run queries on March and September as well to attempt to capture a statistical picture of each quarter-end of the year. This would potentially fill-in or answer any questions related to gaps in other times of the year.
