# Surfs Up: Surf and Shake Shop Investment Analysis of Weather Patterns

##Overview of Analysis
In an effort to open up a "Surf and Shake" shop in Hawaii, it is imperative that I find outside investors to partner with me to get the shop off the ground and running. One particular investor, W. Avy, loves surfing, but is apprehensive about weather impacts on the success of the shop due to a prior investment in a surf shop that failed because of constant rain. 

In order to help boster my cause to gain his trust in investing in my shop, I must run analysis on a weather data set that W. Avy has provided me, for the very island I plan on building my shop on.
